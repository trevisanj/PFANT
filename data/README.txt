Collection of data files for the PFANT suite.

sun -- complete set of data files.
       The command sequence (innewmarcs, hydro2, pfant, nulbad) should run straightforwardly.
       Suggested not to run in this directory thou (this is the repository, keep it clean) -- copy the data files somewhere else.

mghc2cnr_cn3ch13chtiog3tio.dat -- old version of molecular lines file containing less molecules than sun/moleculagrade.dat
