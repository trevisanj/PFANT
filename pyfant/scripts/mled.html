<h1>mled - Molecular lines editor</h1>

<p>This program allows you to visualize and edit the contents of a molecular lines file
such as <pre>moleculagrade.dat</pre> or <pre>mghc2cnr_cn3ch13chtiog3tio.dat</pre>.</p>
<h2>Opening files</h2>

<p>To open a file, invoke the program as follows:</p>

<pre>moled.py &lt;filename&gt;</pre>

<h2>Structure of the program</h2>

<p>The graphical interface is organized in a manner that reproduces
the hierarchical structure of the molecular lines file, <i>i.e.</i>
<ul>
    <li>File properties
    <li>Molecule #1 properties
    <ul>
        <li>Set-of-lines #1 (transition) properties</li>
        <li>Set-of-lines #2 (transition) properties</li>
        <li>...s</li>
    </ul></li>
    </li>
    <li>Molecule #2 properties ...</li>
    <li>...</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Navigation is facilitated by keyboard shortcuts that are shown explicitly.</p>

<h2>Editing information</h2>

<p>Editable items can be selected using these shortcuts:
<ol>
    <li>Molecule properties: Alt+1</li>
    <li>Set-of-lines properties: Alt+2</li>
    <li>Molecular lines: Alt+3</li>
</ol></p>


<h3>Editing (1) or (2) above</h3>
<p>Press Enter or double-click with the mouse</p>

<h3>Editing molecular lines</h3>
<p>Pressing Alt+3 (or its corresponding button) will open another window contaning a table.
As you navigate through this table,
the current molecular line will be marked in the plots with a big
red <span style="color: red"><b>X</b></span>.</p>
<p>You can also click with the mouse directly on the plots, causing the nearest wavelength
be selected on the table.</p>

<h2>Saving the file</h2>

<p><b>Careful:</b> if you press Ctrl+S, the original file will be overwritten with your
changes. It is recommended to backup your file before opening it with mled.</p>

<p>To save it with a different name, press Ctrl+Alt+S.</p>

<p>If the file has been changed, but not saved yet, the word "changed" will be shown in
the title.</p>
