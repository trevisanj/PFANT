# pyfant demos

This directory contains a few usage examples of the ```pyfant``` package.

*Attention* (Windows users): in order to save space, there are links to data files
```../../data/common/*.dat```. These links work well in Linux but not in Windows.
If you are using in Windows, you may have to copy those ```*.dat``` files into this
```demos``` directory.

Linux users: to rebuild broken links, type ```link-to-data.py common```
