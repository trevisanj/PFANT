Sketch of a coding style manual

Format
======

  Indents
  -------
  - Beginning of line: use 6 spaces (not tabs) at the beginning of a line, since most editors seem not to understand the old tabbed format.
  - IF, DO etc indents: let us use only 2 spaces because we are restricted to 72 columns
  
  Number of columns
  -----------------
  - Restrict code to 72 columns (comments may surpass this)

Common blocks
=============
Do NOT use common blocks! Use Fortran MODULE to declare globals!
