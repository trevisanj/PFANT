Sketch of a coding style manual

Format
======

  Indents
  -------
  - Beginning of line: use 6 spaces (not tabs) at the beginning of a line, since most editors seem not to understand the old tabbed format.
  - IF, DO etc indents: let us use only 2 spaces because we are restricted to 72 columns
  
  Number of columns
  -----------------
  - Restrict code to 72 columns (comments may surpass this)

Common blocks
=============
Do NOT use common blocks! Use Fortran MODULE to declare globals!


Data types
==========
"If you must use floating point, use double precision unless you have reason to be concerned about memory use (your program uses large arrays) and you do not need much precision. Modern computers do not take significantly longer to process double precision values than they do to process reals." [1]


Programming
===========

  Verbose
  -------
  Verbose is controlled by config_ALLOW_VERBOSE AND local VERBOSE (logical) variables. To switch on/off verbosing of a particular routine, do as follows:
  
  VERBOSE = .TRUE.  .AND. config_ALLOW_VERBOSE ! Turns local verbose on
  VERBOSE = .FALSE. .AND. config_ALLOW_VERBOSE ! Turns local verbose off
  
  
  Having these bits of verbosing code intercalated with "real" code does hinder the code reading/interpretation, so it is better to use as little verbosing code as possible.
