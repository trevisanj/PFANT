CodeBlocks Fortran is a great IDE for working with Fortran projects.

@note Install "CodeBlocks Fortran", @b not "CodeBlocks".

Project site: http://cbfortran.sourceforge.net/

Running on Linux
================

CodeBlocks Fortran does not require installation. Just download the .taz.bz2 file from the
downloads page http://cbfortran.sourceforge.net/downloads.html and extract it into your
home directory.

@attention In order to run, it must be extracted into your home directory (will create
directory <code>/home/user/CodeBLocks_Fortran_xxxxxxxx</code>).

After extracted, enter directory <code>/home/user/CodeBLocks_Fortran_xxxxxxxx</code> and
execute <code>codeblocks_run.sh</code>

Working with the PFANT Project

In CodeBlocks Fortran, open file <code>main.cbp</code>, which is in the <code>main</code>
directory of the master branch.
