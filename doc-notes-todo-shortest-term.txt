*** ASTROGEAR ***

Astronomy-related applications and APIs written in Python

Astrogear is a collection of astronomy-related applications written in Python and an API that may help you to write your own Astronomy-related applications

---> Collect screenshots, lots of them, then see what to do with them

---> The resources were organized in three packages

---> pyfant: spectral synthesis (using PFANT Fortran software as backend) and editors for related file types

---> Add numbers to sections in README

"Except fo cutr PyQt5" wrong

===> Actually, I should focus on making packages optional!!! Facilitate my import system 
(e.g. creating a proxy for example pyperdrive.imp_gui, imp_robot), isolate dependencies...

---> Explain what packages are optional for what


*** PYFANT ***

Better to explain the package structure, get rid of blah blah at the beginning. Nobody cares

Did I mention screenshots before?

Perhaps exemplify all the programs (but where??)

User's guide is better in PFANT project because the user will need to go through PFANT anyway, and this goes well with my idea of storyline.
This may even include the Python examples!!!


****** AOSSS *****

Straight to diagram, maybe

(aosss) assemble data cube
(remote) run batch of simulations
  (aosss) download simulations results
    (aosss) generate report pages
      (aosss) visualize reports in browser
    (aosss) group results in files
      (aosss) process results (e.g. cut, normalize, calculate metrics (e.g. SNR))
      (aosss) visualize results

praise: use case in readme is fine !!
