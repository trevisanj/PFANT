This directory contains original (practically unchanged) code.

However, the file structure is not the same as in the original.

The original has only two source files:
  - pfantgrade.f
  - pkapgeralgrade.f
  
I split and merged routines to facilitate the study of the code. The files are not to be compiled.

For example, original_merged_reference.f contains all the contents of the two files above to facilitate searches.

Another example, flin1.f and flinh.f contain the subroutines of respective names for file comparison.
