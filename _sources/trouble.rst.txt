Troubleshooting
===============

Tracking down why Fortran binaries fail to run
----------------------------------------------

<<<<<<< HEAD
- If you are running the Fortran binaries directly, error messages are printed on screen.
- If you are running from ``x.py``, the "Runnables Manager" window has a "Collect errors" button.
- If you are running ``run4.py``, open ``explorer.py`` and click the "Collect errors" button.

``run4.py`` or ``x.py`` create **session directories** named ``session-xxx``
containing at least these two files:

-  *commands.log* -- this is the command lines used to invoke the Fortran binaries. This file
   may be useful if you want to specifically reproduce one of these commands for debugging reasons.
   In such case, copy-paste this line in your console to see how the Fortran binary runs.
-  *fortran.log* -- Fortran output is logged into this file.

Your current directory will also have a file named *python.log*,
containing debug/info/warning/error messages from Python.
=======
*pyfant* creates a "session directory" named ``session-xxx`` every
time it attempts
| to run a PFANT binary. Each of these directories will always contain
at least two files:

-  *commands.log* -- this is the command lines attempted. You can
   copy-paste this
    line in your console to see how the Fortran binary goes.
-  *fortran.log* -- messages printed by the Fortran binary.

Commonly, inspecting these files will be enough to figure out what
happened.

| Your current directory will also have a file named *python.log*,
containing
| debug/info/warning/error messages from Python.

.. hint:: ``explorer.py`` has a "Collect errors" button, which
          recurses directories in search for error/warning messages in all files
          named "fortran.log"

Metallicity/temperature/gravity of star is outside range in the grid of models
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<<<<<< HEAD
You can activate option ``--allow True`` to make bypass this check.
=======
You can activate option "--allow True" to make bypass this check, but beware that the calculation
may be incorrect.
>>>>>>> 81dd60a2459da84485987b0c0cc5903be93226df

This can be done in the command line, *e.g.*, ``run4.py --allow T``, or check option "--alow"
in Tab 3 of ``x.py``.

<<<<<<< HEAD
.. attention:: Beware that with ``--allow True`` the interpolation for the atmospheric model may be innapropriate.
               With that option, ``innewmarcs`` will **not** extrapolate the atmospheric model grid,
               but will instead "project" your (teff, glog, metallicity) coordinate onto the closest grid wall,
               then interpolate.
